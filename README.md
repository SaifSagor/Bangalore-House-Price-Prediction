# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
It is a machine learning model which predicts the house price in Bangalore.

This model is trained using a dataset which contains informations about 13321 houses. However this dataset has a lot of missing values and features containing non numerical values. So initially the dataset was not suitable for direct use.

An exploratory data analysis is performed to make the dataset suitable for feeding the algorithm. Multivariate linear regression machine learning algorithm is used in this model and an accuracy of 94.36% is found.
